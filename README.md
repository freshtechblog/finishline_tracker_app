# finishline_tracker_app
Python app that connects to the finishline tracker firmware to run the race and display results

This app is used as a compliment to the hardware which runs the finishline tracker. That firmware can be found at https://github.com/freshtechblog/finishline_tracker_fw

This app allows users to interact with the finishline tracker hardware without having to use the phyiscal buttons. The app will also connect to a google sheet to manage racers and race results which can be useful for running a pinewood derby race.
